        """Create the Touchscreen object. At a minimum you need the 4 pins
        that will connect to the 4 contacts on a screen. X and Y are just our
        names, you can rotate and flip the data if you like. All pins must be
        capable of becoming DigitalInOut pins. 'y2_pin', 'x1_pin' and 'x2_pin'
	must also be capable of becoming AnalogIn pins.
        If you know the resistance across the x1 and x2 pins when not touched,
        pass that in as 'x_resistance'.
        By default we oversample 4 times, change by adjusting 'samples' arg.
        We can also detect the 'z' threshold, how much its prssed. We don't
        register a touch unless its higher than 'z_threshold'
        'calibration' is a tuple of two tuples, the default is
        ((0, 65535), (0, 65535)). The numbers are the min/max readings for the
        X and Y coordinate planes, respectively. To figure these out, pass in
        no calibration value and read the raw values out while touching the
        panel.
        'size' is a tuple that gives the X and Y pixel size of the underlying
        screen. If passed in, we will automatically scale/rotate so touches
        correspond to the graphical coordinate system.
